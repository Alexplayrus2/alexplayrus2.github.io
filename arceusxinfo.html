Entry

If you never heard of Tiah then you maybe have heard of Arceus X, the most known Android exploit currently. Tiah has built his reputation by profitting off people and by people I do not only mean the ones he had worked with, I am talking about not only his partners but even his userbase, besides his "scamming" past with me and other users he is also very known among the exploiting community for logging the accounts of his exploit's users and stealing their valuables (ROBUX, Limiteds, etc.).

I do not want to get into too much detail about the issues with him ripping off his users (although I will provide proof of him doing it down at the bottom) as this thread is just to describe my experience with him and the part where he scammed me.


Our History

I met Tiah a few months past, he had randomly sent me a dm from one of his alternate accounts (I don't know why he did that, he had a lot of weird accounts that he used to stalk on people or discords) asking if I could help him with something and he would pay me for it, our initial deal was I would send him my getconnections code in exchange for $100 USD, I was hesitant at first as I do not like to do business with people that I don't know (the way this ended up should be a good reason why) but after talking to him for a while I said that I would do it if he would send the money first. 
He accepted and sent me a friend request from his main account where we started discussing more about his project, we ended up making another deal where I would sell him a compiler I had made for the price of $4000, we both agreed and the deal went succesfully. Afterwards he told me about this one issue that he had, which was that his exploit would not run on the arm32 arhitecture. He had told me not to worry about that and that he had hired lots of people before out of which none could figure it out, as I am a person that likes challenged I thought that I would check it out, he told me that he would pay me 2k if I ended up being succesful with figuring what the problem was but then raised it to 3k. After a week of research I had found a solution (the problem was that he had no idea how his exploit worked nor the arhitecture that it was running on therefore he was doing EVERYTHING absolutely wrong) and passed it off to Tiah, this business was succesful, I was paid only 2k of what I was promised and he had told me he would pay me another 1k next month (which was still under what was promised) and another 500 for custom functions which was raised to 2k if I also helped him fix and implement more stuff into his exploit. I helped him implement various custom functions, working hours a day at times while he just stood there watching me do the work, I fixed bugs for him while he was maintaining an attitude of superiority and belittling me during all of our calls. I had grown tired of his shitty personality and decided that I had done enough work for only getting paid an additional 1k so I had stopped working for him and told him that my business with him is done, he tried to manipulate me into working for him by telling me I would get paid 4k again and he would pay me even more the following months, I was tempted to accept his offer so I started doing some more work for him but to no avail he kept the same attitude and whenever we talked about getting paid seemed hesitant and came up with excuses.

I had then again stopped working for Tiah, I told him that I was sick and tired of him not doing anything and just being a negative person (I was a little angry when I did it because he just started ticking me off badly with his attitude), I had refused to continue working and told him that I would be ok with taking the $2000 USD that he already owed from the work I had done... which is when he started ghosting me. I did not want to pressure him so I gave him time to respond and he never answered, I knew he had gotten paid but I still did not answered.. which is when I decided I should get revenge. I told him that I would be doing additional work for him which is when he told me he would only pay me 1.5k out of the promised 2k and that he would give me the other 500 when I would be done working, I had told him that this would be unfair and he should pay me 3k instead to which he agreed, but  I was not planning on getting any money from him as I knew that he was full of shit so what I had done is instead of working for him I had hopped into anydesk (we would always use anydesk for working together) and told him that I would send him some files but instead what I had done is I had snatched the Arceus X source code (trust me it wasn't valuable anyways, the only good code there that wasn't pasted was mine).

Which brings us to now, Tiah had threatened to CW me for "scamming"?? I don't know how that makes sense when he is the one that was supposed to pay me for the work I had done but if he does CW me then here is my thread explaining my part of the story, which is completely true and I will provide some images below with further proof to hold up my story.



Proof

Some of the messages could not be retrieved as a lot of our convos were in call and his old account got banned but happily most of the spicy stuff was in this gc we made where I included my partner Berzerker (with whom I work with on Temple) as our deals were considered a deal with the Temple Team.


Our first discussion of the deal
Deal going succesfully
Them showing off with me fixing their 32 bit without even paying me yet
Him imposing extra conditions for paying me
Him saying he would pay me 2k this month for help
Him lying about me not working and trying not to pay me
Him asking me for more work after still not paying
Me asking for the money he owes + pretending I'll do more work so I can steal his source

Extra spicy shit:

I think he is actually mentally insane as he saw himself as an anime character and said he hears voices? (probably just an excuse to not pay me tho)

Him saying he is an anime character and thinking he is above everyone else
Him saying he hears voices in his head??

I won't be posting more of these because they are just unrelated and hold only the purpose to show that this guy's gears aren't in perfect order.


DOXING, Stealing and Child Porn


I made an Imgur album instead so you can go here to see all the other crap he has done.
